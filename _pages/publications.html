    <strong>Abstract:</strong>
    This thesis develops a web-based diagnostic platform for automated classification of colposcopy images.
    It compares three approaches (U-Net+SVM, VGG-19 transfer learning, and CYENET) and deploys the best-performing
    model in a lightweight, multilingual web application designed for resource-constrained settings.
