**Status:** Work in progress.

**Abstract:** Climate variability shapes economic conditions in Central America, but its short-term political effects remain poorly understood. This paper assembles a high-frequency monthly panel for six countries (2012–2024), combining conflict event datasets (MLP and MLEED), climate indicators (temperature anomalies, precipitation, and SPEI-based drought), and inflation-based measures of economic stress. Using ElasticNet to identify relevant lag structures and a mediation design to explore direct and indirect pathways, the paper examines how climate shocks are associated with protest and violence through economic conditions. Preliminary analysis suggests that droughts and temperature shocks are linked to increases in inflation, while direct effects on protest and violence appear limited once economic stress is taken into account.
