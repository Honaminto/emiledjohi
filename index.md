# Emile Honaminto Virgile Djohi

I am an economist and pre-doctoral research fellow affiliated with the  
**[Penn Development Research Initiative (PDRI-DevLab), University of Pennsylvania](https://pdri-devlab.upenn.edu/bio/emile-honaminto-virgile-djohi/)**.

My research examines how structural stressors such as climate extremes, economic risk, and health shocks shape social and economic outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income settings. I work at the intersection of **development economics**, **health economics**, and **climate and environmental economics**, with a strong emphasis on **applied econometrics** and data-driven empirical methods.

This website serves as a central hub for my academic portfolio, including my **curriculum vitae**, **research projects**, **working papers**, **teaching activities**, and selected **extracurricular engagements**.

## Research Focus

At **PDRI-DevLab**, I collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that integrate econometric analysis, geospatial data, and computational tools to address pressing development challenges. My current research agenda blends survey, administrative, and satellite-based climate data to investigate how external stressors affect individual behavior, social outcomes, and economic welfare.

Key areas of interest include:

- **Climate and Conflict:** Linking climate extremes and economic stressors to conflict dynamics using panel data and distributed-lag models.
- **Socio-Economic Impacts of COVID-19:** Studying food security, governance, and social cohesion using harmonized survey evidence across African economies.
- **Attitudes and Exposure:** Examining how exposure to environmental and economic shocks shapes political attitudes and perceptions.

Methodologically, I work with fixed-effects models, quasi-experimental designs, interaction frameworks, and geospatial workflows. I regularly use **R**, **Python**, and **Stata** in my research.

## Academic and Teaching Activities

In addition to my research work, I have been involved in teaching and academic support activities in quantitative economics, econometrics, and computational methods. I assist students with empirical research design, data analysis, and reproducible workflows, and I collaborate on projects at the interface of economics, data science, and public policy.

## Sports & Extracurricular Engagement

Alongside my academic work, I am actively involved in **Wushu (Chinese martial arts)**. This long-term engagement has contributed to the development of discipline, perseverance, and focus—qualities that complement rigorous academic research.

Balancing intensive physical training with research responsibilities has strengthened my time management skills, resilience, and ability to pursue long-term goals with consistency.
