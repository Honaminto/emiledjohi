# Emile Honaminto Virgile Djohi

I am an economist and pre-doctoral research fellow affiliated with the **Penn Development Research Initiative (PDRI-DevLab)** at the **University of Pennsylvania**. My research examines how structural stressors such as climate extremes, economic risk, and health shocks shape social and economic outcomes, particularly in low- and middle-income settings.

At PDRI-DevLab, I collaborate on interdisciplinary projects that integrate econometric analysis, geospatial methods, and data science to address pressing global development challenges. My work spans topics in **development economics**, **health economics**, **conflict and political behavior**, and **climate impacts**, with a focus on causal inference, robust empirical design, and policy relevance.

This website serves as a central hub for my academic portfolio, including my **curriculum vitae**, **research projects**, **working papers**, **teaching activities**, and selected **extracurricular engagements**.

## Research Focus

My current research agenda blends econometric rigor with rich datasets — including survey data, administrative records, and satellite-based climate measures — to investigate how external stressors affect human behavior and welfare.

Key areas of interest include:

- **Climate and Conflict:** Developing datasets that merge monthly climate indicators with conflict and socio-economic outcomes, and estimating distributed-lag and fixed effects models to understand causal relationships.
- **Socio-Economic Impacts of COVID-19:** Assessing food security, governance, and social cohesion through harmonized survey evidence from multiple African economies.
- **Attitudes and Exposure:** Exploring how exposure to environmental and economic stressors shapes political attitudes and risk perceptions.

Methodologically, I apply panel data techniques, quasi-experimental designs, geospatial workflows, and machine learning where appropriate. I work extensively in **R**, **Python**, and **Stata**.

## Academic and Teaching Activities

I have supported courses in quantitative economics, econometrics, and computational methods through teaching assistant roles. My instructional work involves guiding students in empirical applications, data analysis workflows, and reproducible research practices.

I also collaborate on research teams that bridge economics, data science, and public policy domains, contributing to project design, coding pipelines, and dissemination.

## Sports & Extracurricular Engagement

Outside of academia, I am actively involved in **Wushu (Chinese martial arts)**. This long-term engagement has helped shape my work ethic, discipline, and resilience — qualities that complement rigorous academic research.

The training and competitive experiences in martial arts have cultivated perseverance, mental focus, time management, and leadership, all of which support my academic and professional endeavors.
